# Homework Question:
#
# You are given a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a student
# and their scores
# in different subjects.
#
# Student Data:
#students = {
 #{"name": "Alice", "scores": {"Math": 85, "Science": 90, "English": 78}},
 #{"name": "Bob", "scores": {"Math": 70, "Science": 88, "English": 82}},
 #{"name": "Charlie", "scores": {"Math": 92, "Science": 81, "English": 89}},
 #{"name": "David", "scores": {"Math": 60, "Science": 75, "English": 80}}
#}
#Write a Python program that:
# 1. Calculates the average score for each student.
# 2. Stores these averages in a new dictionary where the studentâ€™s name is the key
# and their average score is the value.
# 3. Prints the names of students whose average score is greater than 80.
# Your task is to calculate the average scores for each student and print the names
# of students
# whose average score is greater than 80.
#Solution
